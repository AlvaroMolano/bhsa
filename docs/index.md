## Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (Amstelodamensis)

This is the
[text-fabric](https://github.com/ETCBC/text-fabric/wiki)
version of the Hebrew Bible Database,
containing the text of the Hebrew Bible augmented with linguistic annotations compiled by the
[Eep Talstra Centre for Bible and Computer](http://www.godgeleerdheid.vu.nl/en/research/institutes-and-centres/eep-talstra-centre-for-bible-and-computer/index.aspx), VU University Amsterdam.

The text is based on the
[Bibila Hebraica Stuttgartensia](https://www.academic-bible.com/en/online-bibles/biblia-hebraica-stuttgartensia-bhs/read-the-bible-text/)
edited by Karl Elliger and Wilhelm Rudolph,
Fifth Revised Edition, edited by Adrian Schenker,
Â© 1977 and 1997 Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart.

The [text-fabric](https://github.com/ETCBC/text-fabric/wiki) version has been prepared
by Dirk Roorda [Data Archiving and Networked Services](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/front-page?set_language=en),
with thanks to
Martijn Naaijer,
[Cody Kingham](http://www.codykingham.com)
and Constantijn Sikkel.

## Provenance
The source data resides on a server of the ETCBC, managed by Constantijn Sikkel.
He has made that data available as an [MQL](https://emdros.org/mql.html) database dump, `bhs4.mql`,
together with supplementary data files.

This dataset contains versions of the BHSA:
* **4** fixed, in [SHEBANQ](https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/sources),
  archived at DANS: [DOI: doi.org/10.17026/dans-2z3-arxf](https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-2z3-arxf);
  taken from ETCBC: 2014-07-14.
* **4b** fixed, in [SHEBANQ](https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/sources),
  archived at DANS: [DOI: doi.org/10.17026/dans-z6y-skyh](https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-z6y-skyh);
  taken from ETCBC: 2015-11-03.
* **2016** fixed, based on an data of the ETCBC;
  snapshotted to Zenodo: [DOI: doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.591507](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.591507);
  taken from ETCBC: 2016-11-04.
* **2017** fixed, not present yet, to be snapshotted from version `c` in November 2017.
* **c** continuous version with weekly updates, not yet in [SHEBANQ](https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/sources).

For versions **4** and **4b** the
`bhs4.mql` has been enriched with extra ETCBC data, statistical features and a phonetic transcription
by Dirk Roorda.
This was done using
[LAF-Fabric](https://github.com/ETCBC/laf-fabric) (precursor of text-fabric).
The enriched data has been exported to MQL again, as `x_etcbc4.mql` and `x_etcbc4b.mql`, for use in SHEBANQ.
`x_etcbc4b.mql` has been archived in the DANS repository [Easy](https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-z6y-skyh).
These extended mql files are now present as `source/`*version*`/bhsa.mql.bz2` in this repo.

For versions **c** and **2016** the
[pipeline](https://github.com/ETCBC/pipeline)
has been followed.
These versions have will not be enriched with data coming from research repos.
Instead, additional data from research repos can easily downloaded
from github and be processed alongside this core data.

## Workflow
The pipeline above is complicated and not free of
[cruft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruft).
It would be better if the ETCBC could deliver its core data directly in text-fabric format,
with inclusion of the lexical features, the ketiv-qere data and the paragraph numbers.

## Reproducible science
We intend to follow a practice that allows for data updates on the one hand, and reproduction of old
results on the other.

Besides the continously changing version `c`, we have the fixed, year-bound versions.
In SHEBANQ, 
it will not be possible to publish queries and annotations executed against the `c` version.
It is likely that they will break, when version `c` is modified, week after week.
So, saved queries against this version are not guaranteed to show their original results.

For reliable query saving, every one or two years a new fixed version, called `2017`, `2019`, ... will be added
to SHEBANQ.

Fixed versions in SHEBANQ will remain there forever, and publishing queries and annotations against fixed
versions will remain supported.

In particular, versions `4` and `4b` are here to stay, since they have published queries based on them.
These versions are also firmly entrenched in the academic record, by virtue of being archived.
