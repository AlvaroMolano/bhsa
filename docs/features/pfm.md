**preformative -consonantal-transliterated**

The consonantal representation of the preformative of a word
[BHSA transliteration]({{tfd}}/Writing/Hebrew.html).

This feature is present on objects of type [*word*](otype.md).

For more about features on morphemes, see [word grammar](../wordgrammar.md).

The preformative is a prefix morpheme. It plays a role in verbal conjugation, and helps
to mark person, number and gender for certain verbal tenses.

##### Note
> One of the values is the empty value. There is also an `absent` value.

To mark *not applicable*, the value `n/a` is used, instead of the usual `NA`.
