* [txt](txt.md)


The domain feature is the most embedded (i.e. the last letter of the) value returned by the feature [txt](txt.md).
Example: The sequence of characters corresponds with embedding, so a clause having the txt value “QND”, will return the domain “D”. 

##### Note
> The connection with [txt](txt.md) needs more clarification. 

##### Hint
> Here is a sophisticated query by Oliver Glanz that makes use of this
feature. It detects deviations in a discourse pattern. See the query
on [SHEBANQ]({{shebanq}}/hebrew/query?id=491).
