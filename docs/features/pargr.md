**hierarchical paragraph number**

The (sub)paragraph number of a clause atom.

This feature is present on objects of type [*clause_atom*](otype.md).

The value is a hierarchical section number, like ``1`` or ``1.2`` or ``1.2.3.4``.

A paragraph or subparagraph is started with the changing of the actual set of
actors, through the introduction of an explicit NP-subject, typically
by a WayX or WXQt clause.

The introduction can:
* Add an actor to the (empty) set
* Reverse the roles in the set of actors: parallel connection
* Suspend other actors in the set
